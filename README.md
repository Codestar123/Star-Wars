# Star-Wars
This is a game in which two spaceships fight each other using lasers. It is my first project using pygame. I made this by seeing this video from tech with tim https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO6qQDNa2UY&amp;t=4797s and its original projects link is this https://github.com/techwithtim/PygameForBeginners
